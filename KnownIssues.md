- Deposit funds must wait for the previous one to finalize (eg. balance is shown correctly on the UI). The offchain needs to check whether there's still an on-going deposit to a particular pocket before allowing another deposit to the **same** pocket.
- The offchain needs to filter out UTXOs submitted by non-authorized parties (ie. check whether a UTxO was submitted by a valid key holder)
- Can't delete a pocket when there's no deposited funds at all.
- When deleting a non-empty pocket, the funds are not automatically withdrawn. The UTxO is not lost and is actually withdrawable, but there's no UI for that at the moment.
- The frontend still attempts to display a deleted pocket when there's a pocket key refering to that deleted pocket. Resulting in an error.
